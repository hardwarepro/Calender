# Calender
This is a custom-built calender PCB that allows me to upload my school schedule (or just counting down how many days of school I have left!) via WIFI (on an esp32) to an e-ink display and use it in my locker off a AA battery. When it's at home, it will be able to act as a music player or still a calender, allowing me to plug it in via usb-c or just by using wifi and display live music status.
