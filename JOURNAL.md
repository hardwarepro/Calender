**Project** - This is a custom-built calender PCB that allows me to upload my school schedule (or just counting down how many days of school I have left!) via WIFI (on an esp32) to an e-ink display and use it in my locker off a AA battery. When it's at home, it will be able to act as a music player or still a calender, allowing me to plug it in via usb-c or just by using wifi and display live music status.

**Total time spent** - 14.5 hours

## Day 1 - June 25th- 7 hours
This is the first day I started working on it. I can up with the idea beacuse I use to count down the days of school and mark my calendar on a white board, but with this I will be able to keep it all synced up, and displayed nicely. I started off with doing the schematic. My brother told me to use the SAMD21G18A as it is a nice MCU, and I chose the ESP32 for the wifi ascpect of it. I decided I also wanted an e-ink display as it has maximum power saving and looks cool, so I chose the https://www.waveshare.com/3.7inch-e-paper-hat-plus-g.htm?sku=31061.
Switching from the battery to the USB power was very difficult as I didn't know what chips to use, and the schematic for them seemed hard. With a lot of reading, and a little help, I think I got the schematic all finished up for that ascpect, and overall too. It has one USB-C, a SAMD21G18A-AU, a ESP32, 2 buttons, a rotary encoder, and battery to usb power switching, along with the headers for my display.

## Day 2 - July 8th - 5.5 hours
Today was my first day of routing this PCB. Along with this being the hardest PCB I've routed, it was also only my 2nd one ever, so I was worried something would go wrong. After my brother gave me some optimal spots to place the parts, I started routing it all by myself. I started off with the power, like the battery and stuff, and moved on to wiring the USB lines. Once that was done, I started wiring the power switching stuff. It was definitly hard, especially trying to put everything on only one layer, but after some time I got it. Lastly, everything got routed to the SAMD21, and I called it done for today. I pretty much routed everything to the board.
That whole essay above pretty much sums up 5.5 hours of figuring out the best way to route it with a lot of trial and error. Along the way, I learnt some cool stuff like you can have vias right under parts and what ground pours are.

## Day 3 - July 27th - 2 hours
After totally not forgetting that I needed to submit it, I got back to it, and looked it over with my brother for the final time to make sure everything was good. I found a small error were I needed a pullup resistor on D+ for it to functional properly. Besides for that, there were a few small errors on my PCB, and some routing lines that looked ugly, so I fixed that up. I also added my silkscreen today which is the Google Calender logo, but it's in the copper layer so it looks pretty cool.
